# android-agent-skills

![android-agent-skills banner](./assets/android-agent-skills-banner.svg)

Android skills for people shipping real apps.

Kotlin. Compose. XML. Release work. Ugly legacy upgrades.

An Android skills repository for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot-style workspace skill loading.

## What makes it useful
- `34` skills built around the jobs Android teams actually do.
- One source of truth in `skills/`.
- Real fixture apps you can build, test, lint, and extend.
- A serious rescue path for old apps through `android-modernization-upgrade`.
- Generated outputs for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot-style `.github/skills` consumers.

## Real fixtures
- `examples/orbittasks-compose` gives you a Compose-first app with filters, reminders, sync state, and test hooks.
- `examples/orbittasks-xml` gives you the View-system version with ViewBinding and migration-ready structure.
- `examples/fixtures/*` keeps broken legacy projects around on purpose so the upgrade skill has something real to rescue.
- `examples/fixtures/rxjava-legacy-sample` gives the migration skill a deterministic RxJava codebase to scan and checklist.

## Already wired up
- `python3 scripts/validate_repo.py`
- `python3 scripts/eval_triggers.py`
- `python3 scripts/build_adapters.py --agent all`
- GitHub Actions for validation, packaging smoke tests, screenshot verification, emulator smoke tests, and Android fixture checks.
